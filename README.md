<h1 id="title">Random Questions</h1>

<p id="description">App allows users to input a list of questions each separated by a new line. The app then stores these questions and lets the user draw them one by one — removing each drawn question from the pool to avoid repetition. Users can also save load and delete question sets with all data stored locally in the browser using `localStorage`.</p>
